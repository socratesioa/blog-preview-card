## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to re-create the shadow effect from the design file which can be re-used in cards, buttons etc. I really like this shadow effect.

### Continued development

I really need to focus on writing shorter code by taking advantage of reusable css classes.
